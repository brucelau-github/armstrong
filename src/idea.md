# Idea v1
a node could have many connections with other nodes, each link have a weighted value.

a node could be fired by outside event or if the input is greater than its internal

threshold. then this node would signal out an electrical signal to other node.


# Idea v2
a node has a cycle,

a node has many channel in

a node has many channel out

nodes connect each other by channel

each channel has a weight

a node has a activtion thredhold

could fire by over the threshhold

it can correct him self behavior by learning

has a reinforce channel which give positive or negtive penalty
